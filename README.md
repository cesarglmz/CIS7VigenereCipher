Description:

This program uses a Vigenere Cipher to cipher user inputted plain text and decipher a ciphered 
message. It asks the user to input a string of text they would like to cipher and then
outputs the ciphered text, and vice versa.

This program uses a menu option approach to interacting with the user. It asks the user to
select a number (1-4) for the four options: Cipher, Decipher, Send Message, Terminate.
The selection then calls on the corresponding function for each task.


INSTRUCTION:

Use capital letters only for plain and cipher text. Menu options with Y or N can be written
in lowercase.
